# Full stack Airbnb Clone

[Demo](https://fullstack-airbnbclone.netlify.app/)

Here is a project I did after the full-stack counter to showcase my skills but also to show how robust Apollo Server with React.js can be. The project is a clone of the Airbnb platform which consists of a server and a web page, I also have plans to make an app but because I'm doing it besides my full-time job I don't have enough time. 
The idea was to copy the logic and make a web that "works" but didn't have to look pretty so that it takes me 1-2 weeks but then viewing their design and the interactions I realized that It could be great if I tried to copy most of the design and animations, finally took me an extra week and the result is something I'm happy.
